# AWS
We use AWS primarily for development and sandbox purposes, utilizing a dedicated development account for these cases. For country-specific use cases, separate accounts are maintained. Details for accessing AWS accounts can be found in 1Password.

## Provisioning
AWS resources are provisioned using Terraform. The Terraform configuration files are located in the `terraform` directory [here](../terraform/).
