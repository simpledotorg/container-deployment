# CI/CD
We use both [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/) for our CI/CD pipeline.

A detailed configuration of Semaphore can be found in the [Simple Server deployment documentation here](https://github.com/simpledotorg/simple-server/tree/master/.semaphore).
